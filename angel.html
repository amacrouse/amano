        Angel's Egg was released December 15, 1985.
        It was a collaboration between Yoshitaka Amano and Mamoru Oshii.
        It features very little spoken dialogue, with estimates of about five minutes of total dialouge.
        It's sparse plot and visual style have led to it being described as "animated art rather than a story".
        Senses of Cinema opined that the film "seems informed by the existential desperation caused by the collapse of one's belief system";
        Oshii himself has stated he does not know what the film is about.
